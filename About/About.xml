UPDATE: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2030393196

-----

This mod adds a ground cover made of wood chips.  It is aesthetically neutral and useful for tidying your compound&apos;s outdoor areas.  It is based on Straw Floor by nihiltres.

The mulch is slightly dirty itself (-0.2 cleanliness), but it resists the accumulation of additional dirt and does not contaminate pawns&apos; feet.  (It also blocks plant growth, of course.)

Materials cost: 2 wood logs
Work cost: 2 (in-game scale)
Walk speed: 93%
Beauty: 0
Flamability: 0.75

Includes a burnt version.

This mod should not conflict with other mods.  It can be added to existing games.

A direct download is available here: http://mathbeing.net/downloads/Rimworld/
